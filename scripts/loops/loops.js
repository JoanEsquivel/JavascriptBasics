//Difference between FOR OF & FOR EACH
//-> The forEach loop is another type of for loop in JavaScript. However, forEach() is actually an array method, 
//-> so it can only be used exclusively with arrays. There is also no way to stop or break a forEach loop. If you need that 
//-> type of behavior in your loop, youâ€™ll have to use a basic for loop.
